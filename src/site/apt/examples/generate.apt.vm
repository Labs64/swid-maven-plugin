Generate SWID Tags Examples

  This page provides examples of how to use the <<<download-licenses>>> goal.
  By default, the <<<{{{../download-licenses-mojo.html}download-licenses}}>>> goal will attempt to
  resolve the license of each project dependency.  These files will be downloaded to a local directory
  to be included in the final packaging of the project if desired.  The licenses are downloaded
  based on the url field of the dependency POM.
  
  After downloading the license files, the plugin will create a summary file in XML format which describes
  the license(s) associated with each dependency.  Note that subsequent runs of the plugin will attempt
  to use the existing summary file if found instead of re-downloading the licenses every build.
  If the license summary file is found, only the licenses of new dependencies not in the file will
  be downloaded.

* Basic Example

  This example shows how to configure the <<<download-licenses>>> goal for basic usage.
  
-------------------
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>license-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>download-licenses</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>download-licenses</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
-------------------

  Next run your build:
  
+-----+
mvn package
+-----+
    
  For the <<<download-licenses>>> goal, licenses will by default be downloaded into the directory 
  <<<target/generated-resources/licenses>>>.  This can be configured using the <<<licensesOutputDirectory>>> parameter.
  
* Manual SWID Configuration

  By default the plugin will look at the POM of each dependency for license information.  However,
  not all POMs have been configured with the correct license information.  In these cases, 
  the required license information can be configured manually.  By default, the plugin will look
  for a file called <<src/license/licenses.xml>>.  This file contains manually configured license information
  which will be merged with information from the dependency POMs to create the final license report.  
  The location of this file can be configured using the <<licensesConfigFile>> parameter
  The following is an example license config file.
  
-------------------
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<licenseSummary xmlns="http://mojo.codehaus.org/"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://mojo.codehaus.org/ licenses.xsd">
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.wutka</groupId>
      <artifactId>dtdparser</artifactId>
      <licenses>
        <license>
          <name>GNU Lesser General Public License</name>
          <url>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt</url>
          <distribution>repo</distribution>
        </license>
      </licenses>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>jcl-over-slf4j</artifactId>
      <licenses>
        <license>
          <name>MIT License</name>
          <url>http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</url>
        </license>
      </licenses>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</licenseSummary>
-------------------

  The generated license report follows the same XML format as the manual license config file.
