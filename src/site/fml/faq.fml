                    These SoftWare IDentification tags are simply small XML data files that are installed with the

                    Title, Product Version, Software Creator, Software Licensor, Tag Creator, and Unique Software
                    Identifier.

                <p>
                    Implementation of the ISO standard into SAM and deployment solutions has been slower than
                    anticipated, but many major vendors made commitments to the standard. Please contact your solution

            <question>Whatâ€™s the different between ISO/IEC 19770-1 and ISO/IEC 19970-2?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    ISO/IEC 19770 is a multi-part standard for Software Asset Management (SAM), currently with two parts
                    publicly available for implementation and one 'work-in-progress' part. Each part is identified by a
                    unique suffix.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Part 1 (ISO/IEC 19770-1:2012) outlines business processes for successful software asset
                            management.
                        </li>
                        <li>Part 2 (ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009) outlines the structure for software identification tags, which
                            can be used to improve the accuracy of software inventory collection as part of SAM.
                        </li>
                        <li>Part 3 (ISO/IEC 19770-3:20yy) will provide a software asset management data standard for
                            software licensing entitlement tags.
                        </li>
